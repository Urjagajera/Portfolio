<pre><p>        I am <b>Urja Gajera</b>. currently pursuing my computer science and engineering degree at CSPIT, <b>CHARUSAT</b>.</P></pre>
<pre><P>    passionate about building creative solutions and making a positive impact through technology. Whether it's web development, exploring AI/ML, or learning new tools, I'm always excited to dive into the world of possibilities!
    I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and C++, and I am currently exploring Python and AI/ML. My interests include developing smart systems, working with data, and designing user-friendly web experiences.
    Apart from coding, I love drawing, and sports (I hold a purple belt in karate!), and exploring new ideas that blend technology with creativity.
    I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects, learn from challenges, and grow as a developer. Feel free to check out my projects below or connect with me I would love to chat!

   Let us build something awesome together! </p> </pre>
